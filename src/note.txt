//////error handlein in react route
When an error occurs in a React Router route component, it bubbles up to the nearest errorElement defined in the route.
The errorElement can then access the error using const error = useRouteError();.

You can display or reuse this error inside the error component or in any child components within it.

This allows centralized error handling for routes while still using the error details wherever needed.
